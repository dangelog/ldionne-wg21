## Louis Dionne's proposals for the C++ Standards Committee

The top level of this repository contains the source for the proposals, and
the `generated/` directory contains the generated proposals in PDF format.
The source for proposals that are not being worked on anymore are in the
`done/` subdirectory so I can keep my sanity between meetings.

See Michael Park's paper writing [framework](https://github.com/mpark/wg21)
for how to generate proposals.

#### TODO list
- Paper to claim header names without extension and with double underscores
- Paper to prohibit user specializations of `std::pointer_traits<T*>`
