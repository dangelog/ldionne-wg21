# Introduction

[P2786][] is currently making progress through EWG and LEWG. In Poland, LEWG expressed a strong desire for
that language feature to come with a proper user-facing library interface. This paper proposes such an
interface. That interface is heavily influenced by the uninitialized algorithms that were originally
proposed in [P1144][] which, after implementation experience in libc++, seem to be what's right for the
library.

# Motivation

Today, many algorithms and containers use some flavor of assignment, either as an implementation detail or
as part of their API promise. In cases where the use of assignment is merely an implementation detail, writing
the code in terms of relocation can often result in cleaner code and improved performance (since move-construction
is often faster than move-assignment).

Furthermore, in a future where the language itself provides a definition of relocation (and in particular
trivial relocation), algorithms and containers written in terms of relocation today would benefit from a
massive speedup for trivially relocatable types, without requiring any change.

# Proposal

We propose adding algorithms `std::uninitialized_relocate`, `std::uninitialized_relocate_n`, and
`std::uninitialized_relocate_backward`. We also add the equivalent `ranges::` functions and the
parallel algorithm overloads. At a high level, these algorithms relocate a range of objects from
one memory location to another, which is a very useful primitive when writing containers and algorithms.

However, the library interface proposed here is intentionally independent of the details of the underlying
language feature.

Design points:

- These functions behave similarly to the other uninitialized algorithms like `std::uninitialized_copy`, with
  the difference that the new proposed relocation algorithms support overlapping input/output ranges like
  `std::move` and `std::move_backward`. That is necessary in order to support most use cases where one
  is relocating a range a bit "to the right" or a bit "to the left" of its current location.
- Unlike P2786 which talks of _trivial relocation_, these algorithms talk of _relocation_ in the general
  sense. This is because it's generally more useful (and easier!) to write an algorithm or data structure
  operation in terms of general relocation, even if it is not trivial (in which case it is move + destroy). Even
  non-trivial relocation is usually faster than the equivalent assignment-based algorithm. By encouraging users
  to write their code in terms of general relocation today, we are preparing the terrain for when the language
  gets a notion of trivial relocation, and in the meantime we let implementations optimize under the as-if rule.
- The algorithms provide an exception guarantee that in case of an exception, the whole source range is destroyed
  and the whole destination range as well. Otherwise, the ranges would contain an unknown number of alive objects,
  making it impossible for the caller to perform a clean up. This turns out to work well with what e.g.
  `std::vector::insert` requires in order to provide the basic exception safety guarantee (see the examples below).
- The algorithms accept `input_iterator`s (or `bidirectional_iterator`s for the backward variant) for the input
  range. This iterator category is sufficient to implement these algorithms properly. However, it does mean that
  the range overlap precondition cannot be checked at runtime for some iterator categories. In practice, we would
  expect an implementation that wishes to check this precondition to do so whenever the input range is at least
  random access, which should be the vast majority of use cases.

# Usage examples

In these examples, we ignore allocator support for simplicity, and we use `iterator` instead of `const_iterator`
as the parameter types to lighten the code. The "real" code for implementing these functions does not look
meaningfully different.

The `std::__make_exception_guard` helper is essentially a scope guard that can be "discarded", which is done
after we're guaranteed the absence of exceptions and we don't want to perform any cleanup anymore.

### Assignment based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::emplace(iterator position, Args&&... args) {
  if [[unlikely]] (size() == capacity()) {
    // slow path where we grow the vector
  }

  if (position == end()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(position),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
  } else {
    T tmp(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

    // Create a gap at the end by moving the last
    // element into the "new last position".
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::move(back()));
    ++end_;

    // The element before the last one is moved-from:
    // shift everything else by one position to the
    // right to open a gap at the insert location.
    std::move_backward(position, end() - 1, position + 1);

    // Now there's a gap at the insert location, move the
    // new element into it.
    *position = std::move(tmp);
  }
  return position;
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::emplace(iterator position, Args&&... args) {
  if [[unlikely]] (size() == capacity()) {
    // slow path where we grow the vector
  }

  if (position == end()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(position),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
  } else {
    union { T tmp; };
    std::construct_at(&tmp, std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    auto guard = std::__make_exception_guard([&] {
      std::destroy_at(&tmp);
    });

    // Create a gap inside the vector by relocating
    // everything to the right.
    try {
      std::uninitialized_relocate_backward(position, end(),
                                           position + 1);
    } catch (...) {
      // basic guarantee: vector lost its tail
      end_ = std::to_address(position);
      throw;
    }

    // Relocate the new value into the gap created above.
    guard.clear();
    try {
      // equivalent to move + destroy
      std::__relocate_at(&tmp, std::to_address(position));
    } catch (...) {
      // basic guarantee: vector lost its tail
      std::destroy(position + 1, end() + 1);
      end_ = std::to_address(position);
      throw;
    }

    ++end_;
  }
  return position;
}
```

:::

The relocation based implementation looks more complicated than the assignment based one, but in reality the
complexity only stems from exception handling. The algorithm is conceptually simpler because we just relocate
things around instead of creating artificial gaps that contain moved-from objects, like in the assignment-based
one.

It is also worth noting that both implementations provide the basic exception safety guarantee,
but they provide it differently. After an exception, the assignment-based implementation will
contain the same number of elements as before calling `emplace`, but unknown elements in the
vector will be in a moved-from state. The relocation-based implementation instead ends up with
the elements in `[position, end())` being erased from the vector. It's unclear whether one behavior
is really superior over the other.

It is interesting to note that an implementation that considers the usage of move-assignment to be part of
the function's API may want to preserve that behavior, in which case the relocating code path may be guarded
by `is_replaceable_v<T>` (and otherwise fallback to move-assignment).

Inserting in the middle of a `std::vector<std::string>` is roughly TODOx times faster with relocation
than with assignments.

## `vector::erase`

::: cmptable

### Assignment based

```c++
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::erase(iterator first, iterator last) {
  if (first == last)
    return last;

  auto new_end = std::move(last, end(), first);
  std::destroy(new_end, end());

  end_ -= (last - first);
  return first;
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
constexpr iterator
vector<T>::erase(iterator first, iterator last) {
  if (first == last)
    return last;

  // Destroy the range being erased and relocate the
  // tail of the vector into the created gap.
  if constexpr (is_trivially_relocatable_v<T> ||
                is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>) {
    std::destroy(first, last);
    std::uninitialized_relocate(last, end(), first);
  } else {
    auto new_end = std::move(last, end(), first);
    std::destroy(new_end, end());
  }

  end_ -= (last - first);
  return first;
}
```

:::

Note that in the case of `vector::erase`, we cannot unconditionally use relocation when it is potentially
throwing. This is because `vector::erase` is required not to throw an exception unless `T`'s move-assignment
operator throws. We view this as an overspecification in the Standard that could be relaxed -- this is probably
an artifact of the fact that implementations were assumed to use assignment.

An implementation that considers the usage of move-assignment to be part of the function's API may want
to preserve that behavior, in which case the check for using relocation would be augmented with `is_replaceable_v<T>`.

Erasing in the middle of a `std::vector<std::string>` is roughly TODOx times faster with relocation than with
assignments.

## `vector::emplace_back` / `vector::push_back`

::: cmptable

### Move-construction based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr reference
vector<T>::emplace_back(Args&& ...args) {
  if [[likely]] (size() < capacity()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
    return back();
  }

  // Move or copy all the elements into a large
  // enough vector.
  vector<T> tmp;
  tmp.reserve(__recommend(size() + 1));
  for (auto& element : *this) {
    [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
    tmp.emplace_back(std::move_if_noexcept(element));
  }

  [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
  tmp.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

  swap(tmp);
  return back();
}
```

### Relocation based

```c++
template <class ...Args>
constexpr reference
vector<T>::emplace_back(Args&& ...args) {
  if [[likely]] (size() < capacity()) {
    std::construct_at(std::to_address(end()),
                      std::forward<Args>(args)...);
    ++end_;
    return back();
  }

  // Relocate all the elements into a large enough vector,
  // or copy if moving is potentially throwing.
  vector<T> tmp;
  tmp.reserve(__recommend(size() + 1));
  if constexpr (is_trivially_relocatable_v<T> ||
                is_nothrow_move_constructible_v<T>) {
    tmp.end_ = std::uninitialized_relocate(begin(), end(), tmp.begin_);
  } else {
    for (auto& element : *this) {
      [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
      tmp.emplace_back(element);
    }
  }

  [[assume(tmp.size() < tmp.capacity())]];
  tmp.emplace_back(std::forward<Args>(args)...);

  swap(tmp);
  return back();
}
```
